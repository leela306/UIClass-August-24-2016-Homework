1.One time data binding & two way data binding?

one time data binding:only model to view possible in it and it occurs once when the page loads.when u trying to do the changes again that will not occurs in it because the changes already occured in it.

two way data binding:

model...holds the data of appliction
view...which is visible to the users
model------controller------view.

model to view:
we can make changes from model to view means if you make the changes in the model then they will automatically updated in the view too.

example:
ng-bind is the example of the model to view

view to model:
view to model means if you make the changes in the view then they will automatically updated in the model too.

example:
ng-model is the example of the view to model.ng-model means it will make new model.


databinding from model to view and view to model.
