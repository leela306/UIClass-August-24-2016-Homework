3.what are diff between factory and service? are both of them singleton? what is singleton?

answer:

factory:

we can use all the data types in the factory and we should use a keyword return in factory.
 
service:There is no need to use a return keyword here nad it can only use object datatype only.

both factory and serivce are singletons.

singleton means we will use only one object through out the entire application in the anular Js.
