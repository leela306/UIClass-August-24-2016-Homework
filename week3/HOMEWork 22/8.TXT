5.What is $q?

$q is a  promise (deferred) is a very simple and powerful tool for asynchronous development.it is used for the deferred object.

Asycnhronous development means by default comipler will excutes the code but asynchronous means we will set the priority,fist which method should excutes first.
we will set priorities in Asychrounous method so excution of the methods completly depends upon us.

example:
creation of defered object

var defer = $q.defer() ; 
//  new deffered object has been created.

//defer.promise.then(resolveBlock, rejectBlock);

// registering functions to be excuted on a resolve and reject
defer.promise.then(function(data){
	console.log('the promise has been resolved');
}, function(xhr){
	console.log('this promise is rejected');
})

// invoke a resolve 

defer.resolve(data);

// invoke a reject

defer.reject(xhr);
