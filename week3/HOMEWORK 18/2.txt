2.MVC, MVVM (Data binding)?

MVC....model view controller ,it is two way databinding.
model...holds the data of appliction
view...which is visible to the users
controller...which act as a link between model and view ,they are isolated from each other.if changes occured in the model they are updated in the model throught the controller and vice versa.

model------controller------view.
databinding from model to view and view to model.

MVVM
M--->model...holds the data of appliction
V--->view...which is visible to the users
VM---->view model...it will identify the changes in either model or view and synchroze the chnages in data between them.


MVC is refinement to the MVVM model.
