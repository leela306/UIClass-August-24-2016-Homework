They will make the document more well organised structured way.

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
