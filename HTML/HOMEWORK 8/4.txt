4) java script data types.

answer:

string
String : A strings of any characters enclosed in quotes is a string primitive.

number
Number : A number by itself is a number primitive, all numbers in JavaScript are 64-bit floating-point numbers.

boolean
Boolean : It will store Variables or expressions which are either true or false.

object
Object: A collections of properties and methods. In Javascript, anything that is not a primitive is an Object.

Array
Arrays : Arrays are regular objects, both objects and arrays can have properties and methods.

undefiend
Undefined : It treated as a variable that has been declared, but has never had a value assigned to it.

null
Null : It has only one value in JavaScript: null.

function
function is also one of the javascript datatype.

Undefined:
we tried to create a value but did not assign value to it.undefined means that the variable has not been declared, or has not been given a value.

Examples:

var leela;//shows undefined

typeof leela;//shows undefined

Null:
intentionally we are creating a value blank.null is a special object because typeof null returns 'object'.

Examples:

var leela = null; //shows null
