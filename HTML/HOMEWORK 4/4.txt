4) differences between display none and visibility hidden property?
answer:

display:none:
it  means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all (although you can still interact with it through the dom). There will be no space allocated for it between the other tags.

visibility:hidden:
it means that unlike display:none, the tag is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page. The tag is rendered, it just isn't seen on the page.

display:none--> removes the element from the layout flow.

visibility:hidden--> hides it but leaves the space
