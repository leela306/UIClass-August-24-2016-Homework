2) what is grid system in bootstrap?

answer:

It is very easy to implement grid system by using bootstrap.It allows one row into up to 12 colums.

rules should follow while designing bootstrp grid system:

1.Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding.

2.Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.

3.Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.

4.Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts.

5.Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows

6.Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4
