5.What is $q?

$q is a  promise (deferred) is a very simple and powerful tool for asynchronous development.it is used create the deferred object.

Asycnhronous development means by default comipler will excutes the code but asynchronous means we will set the priority,fist which method should excutes first.
it has two blocks resolve and reject.
we will set priorities in Asychrounous method so excution of the methods completly depends upon us.

example:
creation of defered object

var defer = $q.defer() ; 
//  new deffered object has been created.

//defer.promise.then(resolveBlock, rejectBlock);

// registering functions to be excuted on a resolve and reject
defer.promise.then(function(data){
	console.log('this is resolved');
}, function(reject){
	console.log('this is rejected');
});

defer.resolve(data);//this will invoke resolve block
defer.reject(reject);// this will invoke a reject block

here i have invoked both resolve and reject but it will excutes the first declarative method.

it is asynchronous --it waits for the current script execution to be done and then excutes either resolve or reject which ever is called first.It will wait for the entire script.
