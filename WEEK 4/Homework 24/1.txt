1.promise chaning explain it by an example?

it will excute first the script excution then the excutes the resolve or reject block which is depends upon the programmer which code they called first.if we mention both then it will excutes the code which called first.

defer.reject()//resolve will call
defer.resolve()//resolve only call.
