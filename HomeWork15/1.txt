we can not have add eventlister for all the tags at a time,only one div at a time but you can add multiple events by using this.

document.getElementsByTagName('div').length // it will gives the number of divs available in the document.

by using for loop we can add the event listener  to all the divs but we are unable to identify which div has been clicked.

so we use event.target --->it will tells us event has clicked.
event.target.innerHTML will gives you the content with in the divs.
