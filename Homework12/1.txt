1) constructor? and new key word? why do we use it?

Answer:
by using constructor we can create the object.It is one of the way to create an object.If we have the constructor then we can create as many instances as we can.

suppose if we have  car as the constructor then we can create all the cars from that just by using the key word new.

keyword new is used to create the instances of the constructor.if we mentioned new then it is object.

function person(first,last,age){
	this.firstName=first;             //this is the constructor
	this.lastName=last;                                   
	this.age=age;
}
var suk=new person("sukhana","suku",21);
var lee=new person("leela","lisa",22);           // these are the objects are that constructor
var gowth=new person("gowthami","ghh",22);
