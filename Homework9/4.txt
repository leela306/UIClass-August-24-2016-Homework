4) loop (for, while and do while) and conditons (if else, switch).

for loop:
for(intiliazation,condition,increment)
{
statement;	
}
step-1:fist the value is declared in the intiliazation section.
step-2:it will check the condition ,if the condition is true then the loop starts executing the statements with in the loop,if condition is false then the loop terminates.
step-3:after statement execution incrementation section will increment the values.

 while loop:

 while(condition){
 statement;
 increment;
 }
 while loop check the condition first if the condition is true then loop starts excuting the statements after that it will increment.

 step 1:check the condition
 step 2:if condition is true than excutes,if not then terminates
 step 3:increment the value.

do while loop:

 do{
statement;
increment;
 }
 while();
 do while loop first excutes the statements then increment the value and it will check the condtion 

 step1:first excutes the statement
 step2:increment the value
 step 3:it will check the condition.
