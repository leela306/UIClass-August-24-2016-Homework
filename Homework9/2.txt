1.differences between == and ===

== compares the two varibles whether they are equal or not .== checks the values of the variables,if they are equal then it return "true" if not then it will return "false".

== equal value

=== compares the two varibles whether they are equal or not .=== checks the values  and type(datatype) of the variables,if they are equal then it return "true" if not then it will return "false".
 ===equal value and equal type

exmples:
1.
9=="9" true //returns true because both values are equal
9==="9" false //returns false because values are equal but they have different data types .one is number and other is string ,so they are not equal.

2.7==7 true //values are equal
  7===7 true //values and datatypes (number)both are equal
 

  3.null==undefiend true//both has no value 
    null=== undefined flase //both has equal value but datatypes are different.null is object type and undefiend is undefiend datatype.

   

differences between != and !==
!= compares the two varibles whether they are equal or not .!= checks the values of the variables,if they are not equal then it return "true" if equal then it will return "false".

!= not equal value

!== compares the two varibles whether they are equal or not.!== checks the values  or type(datatype) of the variables,if they are not equal then it return "true" if equal then it will return "false".
!== not equal value or not equal type 
exmples:
1.
9!="9"  false//returns flase because values are equal.
9!=="9" false //returns false because values are equal.

2.7!= 6 true //values are not equal
 "hi"!==7 true //values and datatypes (number)both are not equal

 3."9"!=="hi" true //values are not equal

  3.null!=undefiend false//both has no value 
    null!== undefined true //both has equal value but datatypes are different.null is object type and undefiend is undefiend datatype.
