3.differences between undefined and null?
Answer:

Undefined:
we tried to create a value but did not assign value to it.undefined means that the variable has not been declared, or has not been given a value.

Examples:

var leela;//shows undefined

typeof leela;//shows undefined

Null:
intentionally we are creating a value blank.null is a special object because typeof null returns 'object'.

Examples:

var leela = null;

alert(TestVar); //shows null

alert(typeof TestVar); //shows object

null==undefiend true//both has no value so their values are equal
 null=== undefined flase //both has equal value but datatypes are different.null is object type and undefiend is undefiend datatype.
