3.array methods (push, pop, unshift, shift, slice, splice, indexOf, lastIndexOf, forEach, map, contact, reverse, join, ...).

answer:
arr.length:it will tells the length of the array.

Push:adding the new items at the end of the array and it will return the new array length.

pop:remove the items at the end of the array.

join:join all the array elements

Unshift: adding the items at the starting of the array.

Shift:remove the items at the starting of the array

concate:it will concat the two arrays with each other .

slice():it will extract the portion of the tring.can give negitive values in the slice ,it will take from the last to first in reverse order.
Slice(2,5)…………….>>Arr[2] ,Arr[3]  ,Arr[4] only.
slice(1,3):will give from arr[1] to arr[2] characters.
slice(2):return entire string starts from character 2.

splice():

Splice(firstindex, deletecount,  item to add)
Splice(2,3)
From the value 2 removing 3 values.

reverse:it will give the array in reverse order.

indexof():it will give the index of the array from left to right.
lastIndexof():it will give the index of the array from right to left that is las to first.

foreach function:
Arr=[“leela” ,”lisa”,”akhi”];
in for each function is excuted for each item in the Array.
Arr.forEach(function(item,index,arr)

{
Console.log(item);
})

map:
Arr. map(function(item, index, arr)){

}
A new array is created here whenever the function is returned…
