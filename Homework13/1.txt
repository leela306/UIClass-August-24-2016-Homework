1) java script call apply bind methods? how to use them? what are the use cases when we have to use them?

answer:

both call and apply methods are using to change the value of this keyword to object name permantley.


var place='maimi';
var obj={
	place:'new orleans',
	name:'brad',
	age:45,
	address:{
		state:'ca'
	},
	getPlace:function()
	{
		return this.place;
	}
}
console.log(obj.getPlace());//this refers to the current object
var func1=obj.getPlace;
console.log(func1());//here this refers to the window that is maimi.

//we are applying call method here
console.log(func1.call(obj));//here we are forecefully replace the value of this with oject name
//so it will give neworleans 

//apply method also will do the same thing but we can pass the parameters as array
console.log(func1.apply(obj));

//here we are using function with parameters
function add(a,b){
	return this.c+this.d+a+b; //this refers to the object.
}

var obj1={
	c:3,
	d:4,
	e:6
}

console.log(add.call(obj1,5,4));
//apply method so will pass parameters in an array ,directly passing the array as parameter
console.log(add.apply(obj1,[5,6]));

.bind(objname)--we are creating the new function and permantley we are chnaging the value of this keyword to objName


//bind method
var newfun=add.bind(obj1);
console.log(newfunc(2,3));
both call and apply will excutes the function immidietly.
