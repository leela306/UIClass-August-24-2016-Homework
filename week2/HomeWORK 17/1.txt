1.webservices used for exhnaging the data between client and server
and they are used for the message formating like XML and JSON

in UI we will use only RESTFUL webservices

REST services supported over HTTP 

HTTP methods 
GET...to retrieve the information 
PUT..updating the existing record
POST...creating a new record
DELETE...deleting the existing record.

1.GET method
BY default it will take get method

//we are calling AJAX means sending a request
	jQuery.ajax({
		//this is URL we are using
		url:'http://rest.learncode.academy/api/johnbob/friends/',
		//method is GET 
		method:'GET',
		//success method only excutes when we get the response from the server
		success:function(data){
           console.log(data);
		},
		error:function(xhr){
            console.log(xhr); 
		}

	})

 we need an URL to exmine this methods or to work on them
 this is the URL
 http://rest.learncode.academy/api/johnbob/friends/
