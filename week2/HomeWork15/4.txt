3) what is event bubling and capturing?

event bubling:

if there is parent and child elements,if you click on the child element then parent also invoked because child is inside the parent.there is no need to call the parent here ,if you click on the child,first child invoked then parent invoked.

event capturing:

if there is parent and child elements,if you click on the child element then parent also invoked because child is inside the parent.if you click on the child,first parent invoked then child invoked.

selector.addEventListener(eventType, handlerFunction, captureFlag)

we can set bubbling and capturing by using the captureflag,it is in boolen.
