 event.stopImmediatePropagation?

 we can have multiple event handlers for the same element.if we have one parent and 5 child elements 
 then if we use event.stoppropogation then only child invent invoked.
 if we use  event.stopImmediatePropagation then only first event handler is invoked then it will immediately stop the propagation
